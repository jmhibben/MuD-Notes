    <h1>Welcome to MuD Notes!</h1><hr />
    Your self-contained, Electron-powered, markdown-based note-taking app.<br />
    Current URL: <script>document.write(document.location.href)</script><br />
    <p>Todo list for this project:
    <ul>
      <li>Check Atom source code for Markdown previewre code; may be able to
      utilize it for MuD Notes to process MD source to valid X/HTML code</li>
      <li>Editor need to be designed to highlight MD &amp; check for validity
      (e.g., no missing or misplaced tags); warn user, but stlil allow save in
      case they're unable to fix the issues immediately</li>
      <li>Automatically update preview pane with option to lock scroll of both
      panes together</li>
      <li>Preview pane should be toggleable</li>
      <li>Help file(s) with MD tips &amp; syntax</li>
      <li>
        Allow user to pick syntax (e.g., original, Github, CommonMark, etc)
        <ul>
          <li>Start with either Github or <b>CommonMark</b>, then expand</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>About page should contain info on MuD Notes, Electron, &amp; other
      dependencies, including links to relevant project pages and/or source code
      (when available)</li>
      <li>
        Readme should note that Electron will (currently) need to be installed
        manually to run; include instructions on how to run project as-is
        <ul>
          <li>Eventually, Electron needs to be packed with it &amp; the other
          dependencies so it can be run as a self-contained program</li>
          <li>
            Will likely need to pack Linux, Windows &amp; Mac versions separately
            here due to potentially different file structures
            <ul>
              <li>Will need Mac tester(s); ask around Comp. Sci. department
              &amp; make note of this on Github once it gets to this point</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Platform-dependent installs (versions packed with Electron) may
          need to be kept in their own repositories</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>MD parsers should (ideally) be in JS... or at least be something that
      can be run (read: executed) through Node.js</li>
    </ul></p>
